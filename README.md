# maps
A most simple implementation of a [`map`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table).

As a self-taught programmer, I never knew how maps worked. After this rudimentary implementation, I know understand the basics like:
- They are arrays
- Most of the complexity (beyond hashing) comes from dealing with collisions
- Maps have a limited storage. Fill it up and there will inevitably be a collision
- Linked lists can deal with collisions at an index
